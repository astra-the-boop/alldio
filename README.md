This is a webapp I'm working on that allows you to search for music on all major music streaming sites from one place! It does require you to enter your own API keys though

Here's the links to get them:

- Spotify [https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started)
- YouTube [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/)


Because Apple Music's API requires a $99 per annum subscription (I'm broke), I unfortunately cannot add that. :(

SoundCloud's API App application is also closed as well, so as of now, I'm not able to sign up :(

Deezer's API app application is closed as well# prepPerfect
